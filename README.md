## Time for bootstrap!

In this project, we will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that we learned previously.

We won’t have a lot of instruction, we are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

## Requirements

- Use only HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes

## Tasks

### [0. Read and be familiar with Figma](./)

- Open and study **Nicolas Philippot**'s figma design.

### [1. Header first](./0-homepage.html)

- Let’s start with the Homepage: create the **header/hero** piece.

### [2. Carousel of quotes ](./1-homepage.html)

- By using a Carousel component of Bootstrap, create this Carousel of quotes.

- You can have for the moment one quote or twice the same for testing.

### [3. Popular videos](./2-homepage.html)

- By using a Carousel component of Bootstrap, create this Carousel of video cards.

- Dynamic functionality will be added later. For now, sliding carousel items do not work.
